##Description of the project
1) Firstly prepare data from input with prepare* functions. These functions are implemented in the file prepareData
2) Then I prepare instructions for output. For each type of diagram its own functions are implemented in a separate file. 
Common functions are moved to a separate file HelpGetInstructions
3) Then I display histogram using functions in "structureOut" file.
